FAC21 Week 1 Project 

---
## Challenge
Build an agency website for your team
    - introduce your team
    - information about each team member (About Us)
    - way to get in touch (contact form)

## Agency Name: Loud
Reason: We are a loud bunch, who speak varying levels of spanish, hence the ¡LOUD!

---

## Team Roles: :business_suit_levitating:
Facilitator: Micheal
Deployment: Criag
User Advocate: Safia
Quality: Amy

## Challenges we faced 	:dizzy:
- Initially we created separate html files but we found it was best to have a single index.html
- About us section - 
  - was going to do carousel, but that took to much time!
- Amy and Safia tried to publish, but since we didn't create the repository we were unable to find the settings tab, because we didn't have one. Craig did. 
- We were unable to remove the hamburger menu, in desktop/tablet mode. We tried `visibility:hidden`.` But the menu links were only visible if you click on the hamburger menu icon. We ran out of time before we could amend the JS for the menu

## Tasks :notebook:

We assigned tasks to pairs, and collaborated on the design. 

### Navigation Menu 
Safia and Amy mostly worked on this part, though we did all collaborate together to ensure it fit the criteria and to check everything worked okay.

### About Us Section
Michael and Craig handled this section – specifically design, content and layout.

### Contact Form Section
Safia and Amy worked on this section, using the newly discovered tips from previous workshops!

### Media Queries
These were handled when and where appropriate by our respective groups. We implemented their use  in conjunction with flexbox to elements throughout the page such as the about us section and navbar. 

### Accessibility
- Using Lighthouse tab in chrome developer tools
  - Mobile & Desktop - 97% 
- Manual keyboard and screen reader test

## Lessons learned 	:bulb:
- Always start with a MVP and then spruce things up. We had great dreams about having the about me section as a carousel but that was far to much work for the time we had.
- Although we work in pairs, it is more than ok, if at times we are doing our own research and come back together to finalise things.
- Always `git pull` from github and `git main merge` with the branch you are working on, before you `git push` that branch to github. So that the pull request merges smoothly. 
  - This means after the `git main merge` to your branch, any conflicts that arise can be dealt with in your branch before you `git push` to main. Otherwise you have to deal with it in the pull request.
