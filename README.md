## Challenges we faced
- Initally we created separate html files but we found it was best to have a single index.html
- About us section - 
  - was going to do carousel, but that took to much time!
- Amy and Safia tried to publish, but since we didnt create the repoistory we were unable to find the settings tab, because we didn't have one. Craig did.
